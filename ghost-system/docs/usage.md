# Usage Instructions for G.H.O.S.T. Application

## Overview
The G.H.O.S.T. (Geospatial Heuristic Omniscient System Tactics) application is designed to leverage geospatial data and heuristic algorithms to provide intelligent insights and adaptations based on environmental changes. This document outlines how to effectively use the application.

## Installation
To get started with the G.H.O.S.T. application, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required libraries by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application
To run the application, navigate to the `src` directory and execute the main script:

```
python main.py
```

## Key Features

### Learning from Data
The application can learn from various data inputs. You can provide data in the following formats:

- JSON
- CSV
- GeoJSON

### Adapting to Environment
The system can adapt its behavior based on the current environmental context. You can specify the environment settings in the configuration file or through command-line arguments.

### Geospatial Data Processing
The application includes functionalities for processing geospatial data. You can analyze and manipulate geospatial information using the provided methods in the `geospatial.processor` module.

## Examples

### Learning from Data Example
```python
from ai.heuristic import HeuristicAI

ai_system = HeuristicAI()
ai_system.learnFromData({"key": "value"})
```

### Adapting to Environment Example
```python
ai_system.adaptToEnvironment({"temperature": 25, "humidity": 60})
```

### Geospatial Processing Example
```python
from geospatial.processor import process_geospatial_data

result = process_geospatial_data("path/to/geospatial/file.geojson")
```

## Conclusion
The G.H.O.S.T. application provides a robust framework for integrating geospatial data with heuristic learning. For further details, refer to the [architecture documentation](architecture.md) and the [index documentation](index.md).
