# G.H.O.S.T. Application Documentation

## Overview

The Geospatial Heuristic Omniscient System Tactics (G.H.O.S.T.) application is designed to leverage geospatial data and heuristic algorithms to provide intelligent insights and decision-making capabilities. This project aims to integrate advanced AI techniques with geospatial processing to create a robust system for various applications, including urban planning, environmental monitoring, and resource management.

## Purpose

G.H.O.S.T. aims to:
- Analyze geospatial data effectively.
- Learn from historical data to improve decision-making.
- Adapt to changing environments and requirements.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for interaction with the system.

## Getting Started

To get started with the G.H.O.S.T. application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ghost-system
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**
   Execute the main script to start the application:
   ```
   python src/main.py
   ```
